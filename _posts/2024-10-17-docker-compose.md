Docker compose provides a declarative syntax which helps manage deployments efficiently

---
### Background

- Previously, in [this](https://gouherdanish.github.io/2024/10/10/mongodb.html) article, we saw how database persistance helps us capture user-related data which improves overall user experience
- However, the process that we followed was very manual. We had to setup each container using terminal one-by-one which is not a production-ready workflow practice

---

### Introducing Docker Compose

- Instead of launching different containers one by one, we can write a Docker Compose file which provides the details of every containerized service at one place

```

```
