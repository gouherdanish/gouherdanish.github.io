Computer networking is about connecting two or more computers together

---
### Introduction

- Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that enables a computer or device to connect to a network
- It acts as the bridge between the computer and the physical network medium (ethernet cable or wifi)

### Types of NICs

#### Wired NICs 
- Uses Ethernet cables as physical medium and connects to switches or routers
- Receives/transmits via RJ45 port and supports standards like IEEE 802.3
- Converts digital electrical data into analog electrical signals for transmission and vice versa

```
Ethernet Cable (Analog) → RJ45 Port → PHY Layer (A2D using Line coding) → Digital data
```

#### Wireless NICs 
- Uses air as physical medium and connects to wireless access points using radio signals
- Receives/transmits via RF Front-end(Antenna) and supports standards like IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax
- Converts digital electrical data into analog electrical signal and then into radio waves for transmission
    
```
Air (EM wave) → Antenna (EMW to Analog) → RF Front-End → ADC (Analog to Digital) → Demodulator → Digital data
```

#### Concepts
_What are Full-duplex and Half-duplex NICs ?_

- Full-duplex NICs can send and receive data simultaneously
- Half-duplex NICs can either send or receive at one time

_Diff between Modulation and Demodulation ?_

- Modulation is the process of encoding information into a transmitted signal
    - converting digital signal into analog signal is called Modulation
    - Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM)
    - e.g. In radio braodcasting, audio signals are modulated onto a radio frequency carrier wave
- Demodulation is the process of extracting information from the transmitted signal
    - converting analog signal into digital signal is called Demodulation
    - e.g. In radio reception, a receiver demodulates the radio frequency carrier wave to extract the original audio signal
