A container registry is a repository or collection of repositories used to store and access container images

---

### Background of existing App

- Previously, in [this](https://gouherdanish.github.io/2024/10/07/dockerfile.html) article, we created a Dockerfile for our Streamlit [App](https://gouherdanish.github.io/2024/09/25/low-lying-areas-mapping.html), built a docker image and ran it as a container
- However, the images that we created still reside in our local system and sharing these images to other developers is a painful task as there is no central place to store these images in one place

--- 

### Introducing Container Registry

- When developing container images, you need somewhere to save, share, and access them as they are created, and thatâ€™s where a container registry comes in
- A container registry essentially acts as a place for developers to store container images and share them out via a process of uploading (pushing) to the registry and downloading (pulling) into another system
- Container registries save developers valuable time in the creation and delivery of cloud-native applications, acting as the intermediary for sharing container images between systems

### Types of Container Registries

**Public Registry**
- It is used by individuals or small teams that want to get up and running with their registry as quickly as possible e.g. Dockerhub
- As organizations grow, this can bring more complex security issues like patching, privacy, and access control

**Private Registry**
- Private registries provide a way to incorporate security and privacy into enterprise container image storage, either hosted remotely or on-premises. 
- These private registries often come with advanced security features and technical support
- e.g. AWS ECR, Google Container Registry

### Creating a Container Registry

- In this article, we will explore Github Container Registry (GHCR) as it is available out of the box for all repositories hosted on GitHub

**Step 1 - Create Github Token**
- Go to Github -> Account -> Settings -> Developer Settings
- Click Personal access tokens -> Tokens (classic)
- Create a new Personal Access Token (PAT) giving necessary privileges
  - write:packages
  - delete:packages
  - repo

**Step 2 - Enable Docker Login to Github Container Registry (GHCR)**

```
>>> docker login \
--username <your-github-username> \
--password <your-token-created-in-step1> \
ghcr.io
```

**Step 3 - Listing docker images**

- We can list existing images in local and shortlist the one that we want to save to Container Registry
```
>>> docker images
REPOSITORY                         TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
flood-image                        1.0       cee21ec5dcde   14 hours ago   2.58GB
```

**Step 4 - Tag docker images**

- Tagging a docker image is just creating a copy of the image with a different name
- We can check that a newly tagged image gets created

```
>>> docker tag flood-image:1.0 ghcr.io/gouherdanish/flood-image:1.0
>>> docker images
REPOSITORY                         TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
flood-image                        1.0       cee21ec5dcde   14 hours ago   2.58GB
ghcr.io/gouherdanish/flood-image   1.0       cee21ec5dcde   14 hours ago   2.58GB
```

**Step 5 - Push image to GHCR**

- Pushing a docker image saves it as a package inside Github Container Registry

```
>>> docker push ghcr.io/gouherdanish/flood-image:1.0 
```

- If we look at Github packages, we can see that our image has been published.

### Conclusion

- We introduced Container Registry and saw how it can be used to store docker images in a production setting
- Specifically, we set up Github Container Registry and pushed a docker image there
