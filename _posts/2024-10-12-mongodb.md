MongoDB is a NoSQL database which enables efficient database operations and provides easy-to-use UI as well

---
### Background of existing App

- Previously, in [this](https://gouherdanish.github.io/2024/09/25/low-lying-areas-mapping.html) blog, we created a simple app to locate low-lying areas in Bangalore

- Also, in [this](https://gouherdanish.github.io/2024/10/07/dockerfile.html) article, we created a Dockerfile for the same and built its image and ran it locally as a container

- When opened in browser, the app looks like this

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/low_lying_areas/landing_page.png"/>

---
### Current Issues with our App

1. Whenever the user refreshes the page, his current search village will go away and default village will be shown. This might lead to bad user experience
    - The reason this happens because our current app is very basic with no database persistance
2. There is no way to know which village was searched how many times
    - Again, this can be attributed to database persistance

---
### New Requirements Come

Let's say, we get new requirements to add couple of features into our app 
1. Keep a log for the search history in our app so that we know how many times each villages are searched by users
2. Keep a log for the last searched village in our app so that the user does not lose his current search if the page is refreshed

---
### Database to the Rescue
- The obvious solution to this is to use a database
- We can use MongoDB for this since most users will be searching for their villages and thus DB writes will be more. MongoDB is optimized for write-heavy needs
- Also, MongoDB is easy to use with its Mongo Express UI

---
### Let's setup MongoDB
- MongoDB can be setup using Docker very easily

**Step 1 - Pull images**
- Pull `mongo` and `mongo-express` images from Dockerhub

```
docker pull mongo
docker pull mongo-express
```

**Step 2 - Create new Docker Network**

```
docker network create mongo-network
```

**Step 3 - Run Containers**
- Start MongoDB container using `docker run` command

```
docker run -d \                                                                     
-p 27017:27017 \ 
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin \
-e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password \
--network mongo-network \
--name mongodb \
mongo
```

- Next, start Mongo Express container
- Make sure to specify the MongoDB server details as per the above `mongodb` container
```
docker run -d \                                                                     
-p 8081:8081 \
--name mongoui \
--network mongo-network \
-e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb \
-e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin \
-e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=password \
mongo-express
```

Note
- Make sure to run both in same network so that the container can communicate natively

**Step 4 - Check containers**
- Both containers should be running

```
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                      NAMES
2325792727d9   mongo-express     "/sbin/tini -- /dock…"   2 days ago       Up 2 days       0.0.0.0:8081->8081/tcp     mongoui
e29bf436c061   mongo             "docker-entrypoint.s…"   2 days ago       Up 2 days       0.0.0.0:27017->27017/tcp   mongodb
```

**Step 5 - Check Mongo UI**
- Open 0.0.0.0:8081 on browser for Mongo Express UI
- The first time it asks for login, we can use `admin` as user and `pass` as password

**Step 6 - Create Document and Collection on MongoUI**

### How to implement
After the Database has been setup, now it is time to implement the new features in our app. We can implement the above requirements using MongoDB Crud Operations. The implementation logic is given below

- Find the village whose last searched flag is True and use that for display instead of default village
    - At start, when database has no entries available, select default village having index 0
- Upsert the current village into the collection by incrementing its search counter by 1 and setting its last searched flag to True
- Update the last searched flag to False for all other villages in the collection 

For detailed implementation, please refer
[Github Repo](https://github.com/gouherdanish/urban_flooding)

### Let's Dockerize it

Now that the new features are implemented in our app, the docker image needs to be rebuilt and a new container must be launched. We can follow below steps for this.

**Stop Container**
- stop running container
- remove the container
- remove the image

```
docker stop flood-ctnr
docker rm flood-ctnr
docker rmi flood-image:1.0
```

**Build Image**
- build docker image and tag appropriately

```
docker build -t flood-image:1.0 .
```

**Launch Container**
- We can launch a docker container for our app in two ways

**Setup 1**
- We can launch the container in a different network than what we setup for mongo above
- Below we do not specify any network while launching container so Docker assings Bridge network by default

```
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --name flood-ctnr flood-image:1.0
```

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/mongo/arch1.png">

**Setup 2**
- We can launch the container in the same network as mongodb

```
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --network mongo-network --name flood-ctnr flood-image:1.0
```

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/mongo/arch2.png">

Note:
- We can make both the setup work by making sure the Pymongo MongoClient uses appropriate connection URL as shown above
- However, since sontainers in the same network can talk to each other using just the container names, in that sense, the Setup 2 looks convenient 

---

### App is Ready !!

- Our Landing page looks like this with default village selected 
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/mongo/start.png">

- If user selects new village, it is marked as last and its count is updated in the sidebar table
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/mongo/other.png">

- If the user refreshes the page, he is still shown his last searched village
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/mongo/another.png">

### Conclusion

- We implemented database interaction in our Streamlit app using MongoDB Crud operations
- We used docker network to enable seamless communication between our containers
