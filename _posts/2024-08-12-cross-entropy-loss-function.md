### Definition

#### Entropy

- Entropy is a concept from information theory introduced by Claude Shannon in 1948. 
- It measures the uncertainty or randomness in a probability distribution. 
- In the context of machine learning and data science, entropy quantifies the unpredictability or impurity in a dataset.

```math
H\left(X)\right = -\sum_{i=1}^n p\left( x_i \right) log_2 p\left( x_i \right)
```
