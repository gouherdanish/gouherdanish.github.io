Q-Learning is an off-policy temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm

---
### Intuition

- Q stands for Quality
- It is an example of off-policy TD prediction methods for the control problem
    - control problem deals with estimating action-value functions
-  It updates Q-values based on the reward received and the maximum estimated Q-value of the next state regardless of the action that the current policy would take

---

### Off-policy Learning

- It separates exploration from exploitation. 
- The agent can explore using one policy (like a random policy) while learning the optimal policy independently. 
- The learning process is not affected by the exploration strategy.
- This flexibility allows the agent to learn from different sources of experience, including past data, simulated experiences, or experiences generated by a different agent.

---

### Update Rule

- For an on-policy method we must estimate the action value $q_{\pi}(s, a)$ for the current behavior policy $\pi$ and for all states `s` and actions `a`

$$ {Q}(S_t,A_t) \leftarrow {Q}(S_t,A_t) + \alpha \left (R_{t+1} + \gamma max_{a'}Q(S_{t+1},a') - {Q}(S_t,A_t) \right ) $$

- This update is done after every transition from a state $S_t$ unless it is a terminal state $S_T$

- If $S_{t+1}$ is terminal then $Q(S_{t+1},A_{t+1}) = 0$

---

### Hand Calculation

#### Example

- Let's take an example of 2*2 Gridworld 

```
1 - 2
|   |
3 - 4
```

#### Initial Conditions
- Start State: (1,1) or cell 1 (top-left corner)
- Goal State: (2,3) or cell 4 (bottom-right corner)
- Actions: Up, Down, Left, Right
- Reward Structure: +1 for reaching the goal (cell 9), and 0 for all other cells.
- Initial Q-values: Assume all Q-values are initialized to 0.
- Learning Rate ($\alpha$): 0.5
- Discount Factor ($\gamma$): 0.9

Initial Q-table looks like this

| State | Action | $Q(s,a)$ |
| - | - |
| 1 | Up | 0 |
| 1 | Down | 0 |
| 1 | Left | 0 |
| 1 | Right | 0 |
| 2 | Up | 0 |
| 2 | Down | 0 |
| 2 | Left | 0 |
| 2 | Right | 0 |
| 3 | Up | 0 |
| 3 | Down | 0 |
| 3 | Left | 0 |
| 3 | Right | 0 |
| 4 | Up | 0 |
| 4 | Down | 0 |
| 4 | Left | 0 |
| 4 | Right | 0 |

#### Episode 1

Let's assume the agent follows the following path during episode 1

$$ State 1 \rightarrow Right \rightarrow State 2 \rightarrow Down \rightarrow State 4 $$

**Step 1**

- Agent moves right from state 1 to state 2
- No reward in the next state, so $R_{t+1} = 0$
- At 2, max q-value out of all the actions is 

$$ \max_{a'} Q(2,a') = max(Q(2,UP), Q(2,DOWN), Q(2,LEFT),Q(2,RIGHT))= max(0,0.5,0,0) = 0.5 $$

- Applying Update rule

$$ {Q}(1,Right) \leftarrow {Q}(1,Right) + \alpha \left (R_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(2,a') - {Q}(1,Right) \right ) $$

$$ {Q}(1,Right) \leftarrow 0 + 0.5(0 + 0.9*0 - 0) $$

$$ {Q}(1,Right) \leftarrow 0 $$

**Step 2**

- Agent moves down from state 2 to state 4
- Since 4 is goal state, so $R_{t+1} = 1$
- Since 4 is goal state, any action that takes agent away from 4 should have no value, so $Q(4,a') = 0$

$$ {Q}(2,Down) \leftarrow {Q}(2,Down) + \alpha \left (R_{t+1} + \gamma \max{a'} Q(2,a') - {Q}(2,Down) \right ) $$

$$ {Q}(2,Down) \leftarrow 0 + 0.5(1 + 0.9*0 - 0) $$

$$ {Q}(2,Down) \leftarrow 0.5 $$

**Updated Q-table**

| State | Action | $Q(s,a)$ |
| - | - |
| 1 | Down | 0 |
| 1 | Right | 0 |
| 2 | Down | 0.5 |
| 2 | Left | 0 |
| 3 | Up | 0 |
| 3 | Right | 0 |
| 4 | Up | 0 |
| 4 | Left | 0 |

#### Episode 2

Let's assume the agent follows the following path during episode 2

$$ State 1 \rightarrow Right \rightarrow State 2 \rightarrow Left \rightarrow State 1 \rightarrow Right \rightarrow State 2 \rightarrow Down \rightarrow State 4 $$

**Step 1**

- Agent moves right from state 1 to state 2
- Since 2 is not the goal state, so $R_{t+1} = 0$
- At 2, max q-value out of all the actions is 

$$ \max{a'} Q(2,a') = max(Q(2,UP), Q(2,DOWN), Q(2,LEFT),Q(2,RIGHT))= max(0,0.5,0,0) = 0.5 $$

- Applying Update rule

$$ {Q}(1,Down) \leftarrow {Q}(1,Down) + \alpha \left (R_{t+1} + \gamma \max{a'} Q(2,a') - {Q}(1,Down) \right ) $$

$$ {Q}(1,Down) \leftarrow 0 + 0.5(0 + 0.9*0 - 0) $$

$$ {Q}(1,Down) \leftarrow 0 $$

**Step 2**

- Agent moves down from state 3 to state 1
- Since 1 is not the goal state, so $R_{t+1} = 0$

$$ {Q}(3,Up) \leftarrow {Q}(3,Up) + \alpha \left (R_{t+1} + \gamma Q(1,Down) - {Q}(3,Up) \right ) $$

$$ {Q}(3,Up) \leftarrow 0 + 0.5(0 + 0.9*0 - 0) $$

$$ {Q}(3,Up) \leftarrow 0 $$

**Step 3**

- Agent moves down from state 1 to state 3
- Since 3 is not the goal state, so $R_{t+1} = 0$

$$ {Q}(1,Down) \leftarrow {Q}(1,Down) + \alpha \left (R_{t+1} + \gamma Q(3,Right) - {Q}(1,Down) \right ) $$

$$ {Q}(1,Down) \leftarrow 0 + 0.5(0 + 0.9*0 - 0) $$

$$ {Q}(1,Down) \leftarrow 0 $$

**Step 4**

- Agent moves down from state 3 to state 4
- Since 4 is goal state, so $R_{t+1} = 1$
- Since 4 is goal state, any action that takes agent away from 4 should have no value, so $Q(4,a') = 0$

$$ {Q}(3,Right) \leftarrow {Q}(3,Right) + \alpha \left (R_{t+1} + \gamma Q(4,a') - {Q}(3,Right) \right ) $$

$$ {Q}(3,Right) \leftarrow 0 + 0.5(1 + 0.9*0 - 0) $$

$$ {Q}(3,Right) \leftarrow 0.5 $$

**Updated Q-table**

| State | Action | $Q(s,a)$ |
| - | - |
| 1 | Down | 0.158 |
| 1 | Right | 0.225 |
| 2 | Down | 0.5 |
| 2 | Left | 0 |
| 3 | Up | 0.10125 |
| 3 | Right | 0.5 |
| 4 | Up | 0 |
| 4 | Left | 0 |
