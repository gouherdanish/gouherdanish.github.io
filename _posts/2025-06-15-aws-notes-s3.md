S3 stands for Simple Storage Service

---
### Introduction

- S3 is object storage
- When you store data in object storage, it's encapsulated into an object
- Objects are accessed using their unique identifier, eliminating the need to traverse a hierarchical file system

---
### Bucket

- Objects are stored in a flat, single-level structure, often called a bucket
- Buckets are created in your account and must have a globally unique name
- Although S3 looks like a global service, buckets are actually created in a specific AWS region

---
### Objects

- objects are files and they have a key which is the full path of your file
- Keys are very long names that contain slashes and are made of a prefix and an object name
- Ex:

```
Path = s3://dan-bucket/images/cars/bentley.jpg

Bucket Name = dan-bucket
Key = images/cars/bentley.jpg
Prefic = images/cars
Object Name = bentley.jpg
```
