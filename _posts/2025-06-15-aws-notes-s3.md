S3 stands for Simple Storage Service

---
### Introduction

- S3 is object storage
- When you store data in object storage, it's encapsulated into an object
- Objects are accessed using their unique identifier, eliminating the need to traverse a hierarchical file system

---
### Bucket

- Objects are stored in a flat, single-level structure, often called a bucket
- Buckets are created in your account and must have a globally unique name
- Although S3 looks like a global service, buckets are actually created in a specific AWS region

---
### Objects

- objects are files and they have a key which is the full path of your file
- Keys are very long names that contain slashes and are made of a prefix and an object name
- Ex:

```
Path = s3://dan-bucket/images/cars/bentley.jpg

Bucket Name = dan-bucket
Key = images/cars/bentley.jpg
Prefic = images/cars
Object Name = bentley.jpg
```

- Max object size of 5TB supported
- Above 5GB, multi-part upload must be used
- Metadata, tags, and versioning can be associated with objects to enhance management and security.

---
### Security

- Two types of policies
    - User-based - IAM permissions
    - Resource-based - Bucket policies, Access Control Lists (Object level)
- An outside user can access an s3 object if bucket policy allows it i.e. Bucket is public
- An IAM principal can access an s3 object 
    - if IAM permissions ALLOW it or Bucket policies ALLOW it
    - and if there is no explicit DENY
- Objects can be encrypted for security

---
### Versioning

- We can enable versioning of files so that changes are tracked
    - Overwriting the same key (file) will change its version
    - Deleting a key will add a Delete Marker
- Versioning is enabled at bucket level
- Null versions are assigned to existing files 
- Suspending versioning will not delete previous versions

---
### Replication

- Goal: To keep a replica of the data in s3 bucket in one Region to another region
- Two Types
    - Same Region Replication (SRR)
    - Cross Region Replication (CRR)
- Required
    - Versioning must be enabled on both source and destination buckets
    - S3 service must have IAM permission to read from source bucket and write to the destination bucket
- Replication happens asynchronously in the background
- Cross account replication can be done with CRR

---
### S3 Durability

- It refers to the likelihood of losing an object stored in Amazon S3
- S3 offers extremely high durability, known as "11 nines," which means 99.999999999% durability
- It means that if you store 10 million objects, you can expect to lose only one object every 10,000 years on average
- This durability level is consistent across all storage classes

--- 
### S3 Availability

- indicates how readily the S3 service can be accessed
- varies by storage class

---
### Storage Classes

- Standard 
    - frequently accessed data
    - low latency, 99.99% HA
    - used in big data, gaming etc
- Infrequent Access 
    - less frequently accessed data needing rapid access when needed; 
    - less cost than Standard, incurs retrieval cost
    - 99.9% HA, used in disaster recovery, backups
- One-Zone Infrequent Access
    - stores data in single AZ (might incur data loss)
    - 99.5% HA
    - used for secondary backup copies of on-premises data (data that can be re-created)
- Glacier Archive - low cost options for archival and backups
    - Instant Retrieval - (ms)
    - Flexible Retrieval - 
        - Expedited - (1-5 min)
        - Standard - (3-5 hrs)
        - Bulk - (5-12 hrs) (free)
    - Deep Archive - lowest cost
        - Standard - (12 hrs)
        - Bulk - (48 hrs)
- Intelligent Tiering
    - S3 optimizes storage costs by moving objects across tiers based on usage patterns
    - Allows user to "set and forget"
    - No retrieval fee, incurs auto-tiering fee
