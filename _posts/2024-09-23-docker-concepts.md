Docker is an important tool when it comes to software development.

---
### Introduction

- Docker is a way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration. (Isolation)
- The packaged artifact can be shared among different teams and it will work seamlessly (Portability)
- This makes development and deployment process more efficient

---
### Background

**Before Docker**
- The software development process was tedious and inefficient before Docker came
- Let's say developer1 developed a service with necessary dependencies installed in his local machine.
- If he wants to hand over the code to other developer/tester, the other developer needs to install the dependencies again which can have many bottlenecks
    - The dependencies versions may not match
        - can be solved by specifying dependency and versions in requirements.txt file
    - Different developers may have different OS for which the installation process will be different.
    - There are multiple steps during installation and there might be chances of errors


### Concepts
