Quantization is the art of trading precision for efficiencyâ€”where every bit saved fuels faster, leaner, and smarter AI 

---

### Definition
- Quantization is a technique used in deep learning.
- It converts high-precision floating-point values into lower-precision formats while trying to preserve model accuracy.

**High Precision Formats**
- Double Precision (FP64)
- Single Precision (FP32)

**Low Precision Formats**
- Half Precision (FP16)
- 8-bit Integer (INT8)
- 16-bit Integer (INT16)

### Conclusion
- We introduced Quantization and explored various techniques
