I was born on the 1st of Jan which some say is special.

I like to play Table Tennis when I get some time. Also I like card games.

On the professional front, I am a graduate in Mechanical Engineer from IIT Bhubaneswar, India. 
Currently I am working as a Data Science Architect at AiDash India Pvt Ltd, Bangalore.

On the personal side, I am a husband and a father of a 2 year old son. 
I love to spend time with him in my free time.

Also, I love to learn new things and expand my knowledge horizon. 
I started this blog to document these learnings as I move along in my professional journey
